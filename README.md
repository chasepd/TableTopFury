# Tabletop Fury

## What this is

Tabletop Fury is a partially-completed game roughly similar to 2D ping-pong, and probably reminicent of other similar 2D games.
First and foremost this is a learning project for me, as I figure out the ins and outs of game development and [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/).
It may or may not ever be finished.

## What technologies are included

This is built in C# using the MonoGame Framework.


## What Works
Currently the following features work:

- Versus match between 2 Players
- Versus match with 1 player and an AI player
- Scaling between resolutions (mostly...no guarantees)
- Back buttons in the menus
- Menu music and match music
- Basic sound effects for collisions and paddle boosters
- The Exit button


## What Doesn't Work (but is in the UI)
The following things are implied in the UI but don't work or exist yet:

- A single player campaign
- The ability to reset single player progress
- The ability to change resolutions or toggle fullscreen without editing code
- The ability to adjust volume levels for various types of sound
- The ability to set custom controls (it's just up and down arrows for menus, and W-S for Player 1 and Up and Down for player 2 in versus mode)
- Controlling anything with a mouse
