# Tabletop Fury

## What this is

Tabletop Fury is a partially-completed game roughly similar to 2D ping-pong, and probably reminicent of other similar 2D games.
First and foremost this is a learning project for me, as I figure out the ins and outs of game development and [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/).
It may or may not ever be finished.

## What technologies are included

This is built in C# using the MonoGame Framework.


## What Works
Currently the following features work:

- Versus match between 2 Players
- Versus match with 1 player and an AI player
- Scaling between resolutions (mostly...no guarantees)
- Back buttons in the menus
- Menu music and match music
- Basic sound effects for collisions and paddle boosters
- The Exit button


## What Doesn't Work (but is in the UI)
The following things are implied in the UI but don't work or exist yet:

- A single player campaign
- The ability to reset single player progress
- The ability to change resolutions or toggle fullscreen without editing code
- The ability to adjust volume levels for various types of sound
- The ability to set custom controls (it's just up and down arrows for menus, and W-S for Player 1 and Up and Down for player 2 in versus mode)
- Controlling anything with a mouse 

## Can I submit a PR to include something/implement something/modify something?
Of course.

## Can I log an issue for a bug I found?
Sure, but no guarantees it will get fixed promptly, or ever. If it's really bugging you (pun intended) then fix it and submit a PR (and thanks in advance!).

## What Will Be Added
Whatever I feel like adding or that someone feels like submitting a PR for.

## Why the GPL license instead of MIT License?
There are a lot of things I think the MIT License makes sense for - a lot of the internet is built on the MIT license. However, for a game,
I feel like GPL makes more sense. Want to take this code and fix it up and make something really cool out of it? Awesome! But let the rest of us learn 
from you too and share your source code like this is shared. Not that this is particularly great or worthy of using, but it's more of the spirit of the thing.

You should also note that not everything here is licensed under the GPL license. Specifically, the MonoGame framework that this uses is available
under the MIT License.
